# This code is written as part of the EPSRC project - "Models in the Cloud" - Ensemble 2017-2019.

# WRF-Python-Azure
# This code creates a cluster of machines having WRF installed on it to support running simulations.

# Required inputs
# 1) Machine images of WRF-master and WRF-client. These images can be created by following a code on the following web page AAA.
# 2) We have provided some options of VM machine configurations which work while running our simulations. These are suitable to run 4 month simulations.
# 3) You have to provide Azure credentials in a file, credentials.txt. Make sure not to add any extra blank space at end of line.
# 4) You have to use same login and password which are used while creating mother machine images.
# 5) We would recommend to stick with the default settings/values in the code.
